# _catede_

The python software _catede_ is a collection of different estimation methods for the entropy and divergence in the context of categorical distribution with finite number of categories.
Provided a data sample in the shape of a list or other comprehensive supported formats, the software provides methods to estimate the Shannon entropy, the Simpson index, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance.
In particular it provides the code for the Unbiased Dirichlet prior Mixture estimators for the divergence, presented in `Missing Paper`.
